If you believe any of this , I can make you a real deal on leftover Enron stock that will double in value a week from Friday .
Impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly .
In all , this is a watchable movie that 's not quite the memorable experience it might have been .
In an effort , I suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .
In exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if I 'd been sitting naked on an igloo , Formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .

It can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull .
It does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored .
It does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28K modem .
It feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .
It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .
It has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .
It made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .
It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .
It showcases Carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff .

Part low rent Godfather .
Partway through watching this saccharine , Easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected TV show .
Passable entertainment , but it 's the kind of motion picture that wo n't make much of a splash when it 's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards .

Pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer Adam Larson Broder and his co-director , Tony R. Abrams , in their feature debut .

Slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler 's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?
So devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like XXX and Collateral Damage seem like thoughtful treatises
So unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .
Some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .
Something like scrubbing the toilet .
Sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest .
Stealing Harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time .

The Movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ai n't pretty .
The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom , Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately do n't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .

The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .
The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .
The humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .

This is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it 's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .
This is so bad .
