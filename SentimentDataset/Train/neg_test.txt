Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .
Formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip .
Frankly , it 's pretty stupid .

How this one escaped the Lifetime network I 'll never know .
Humor in I Spy is so anemic .
I 'd rather watch a rerun of The Powerpuff Girls

I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen .
I 'm sure there 's a teenage boy out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment .
I also believe that Resident Evil is not it .
I ca n't recommend it .

It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .
It dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum .
It does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .
It drowns in sap .
It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .
It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .
It has no affect on the Kurds , but it wore me down .
It irritates and saddens me that Martin Lawrence 's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2,500 screens while something of Bubba Ho Tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere .
It is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound .
It is n't quite one of the worst movies of the year .
It is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
It is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film .
It leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .
It made me realize that we really have n't had a good cheesy B movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's Reign of Fire .
It may as well be called `` Jar Jar Binks : The Movie . ''
It never rises to its clever what if concept .
It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .
It squanders Chan 's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander Jennifer Love Hewitt !
It sucked .
It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .
Its appeal will probably limited to LDS Church members and undemanding armchair tourists .
Its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like Prophet Jack , might have made a point or two regarding life .
Its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer director Roger Avary .
Jackass is a vulgar and cheap looking version of Candid Camera staged for the Marquis de Sade set .
Jaw droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as John Ritter 's glory days on Three 's Company .
Just a Kiss is a just a waste .
Just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making Ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .
Just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills .
Just dreadful .
Just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name .
Kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities .
Killing time , that 's all that 's going on here .
Knockaround Guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be Quentin Tarantino when they grow up .
Kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business .
Lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child 's interest and an adult 's patience .
Laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany .
Lawrence should stick to his day job .
Leaks treacle from every pore .
Less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .
Like Rudy Yellow Lodge , Eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider .
Like a can of 2 day old Coke .
Like a medium grade network sitcom    mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen .
Like an Afterschool Special with costumes by Gianni Versace , Mad Love looks better than it feels .
Like its title character , Esther Kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating .
Like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior ... Circuit gets drawn into the party .
Like the excruciating End of Days , Collateral Damage presents Schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions .
Little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick .
