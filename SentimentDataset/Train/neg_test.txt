Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .
Formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip .
Frankly , it 's pretty stupid .

How this one escaped the Lifetime network I 'll never know .
Humor in I Spy is so anemic .
I 'd rather watch a rerun of The Powerpuff Girls

I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen .
I 'm sure there 's a teenage boy out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment .
I also believe that Resident Evil is not it .
I ca n't recommend it .

Twenty three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , Clint Eastwood 's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him .
Two bit potboiler .
Ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing .
Um ... is n't that the basis for the entire plot ?
Unfortunately , Kapur modernizes A.E.W. Mason 's story to suit the sensibilities of a young American , a decision that plucks `` The Four Feathers '' bare .
Unfortunately , that 's precisely what Arthur Dong 's Family Fundamentals does .
Unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
Unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , Impostor is opening today at a theater near you .

Upper Teens may get cynical .
Vaguely interesting , but it 's just too too much .
Very stupid and annoying .
Viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who 's who in this pretentious mess .
Wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from Lynch , Jeunet , and von Trier while failing to find a spark of its own .
Watching Queen of the Damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in .
Watching this film , what we feel is n't mainly suspense or excitement .
We ca n't accuse Kung Pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind numbingly , indescribably bad movie .
We do n't get paid enough to sit through crap like this .
We never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity .
Weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting .
Well , this movie proves you wrong on both counts .
Were Dylan Thomas alive to witness first time director Ethan Hawke 's strained Chelsea Walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , ` Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Theatre . '
What 's infuriating about Full Frontal is that it 's too close to real life to make sense .
What 's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy .
What ` Blade Runner ' would 've looked like as a low budget series on a UHF channel .
What an embarrassment .
What goes on for the 110 minutes of `` Panic Room '' is a battle of witlessness between a not so bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals .
What might have been acceptable on the printed page of Iles ' book does not translate well to the screen .
What should have been a cutting Hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week 's issue of Variety .
What starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film .
What ultimately makes Windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .
What with all the blanket statements and dime store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .
When ` science fiction ' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience has n't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre .
When not wallowing in its characters ' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom worthy solutions to their problems .
When you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble .
Where This was lazy but enjoyable , a formula comedy redeemed by its stars , That is even lazier and far less enjoyable .
Whether Jason X is this bad on purpose is never clear .
While Solondz tries and tries hard , Storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket .
While it 's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own .
While some of the camera work is interesting , the film 's mid to low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work .
While the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one hour TV documentary .
While this one gets off with a good natured warning , future Lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
Whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black .
Why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me .
Why would anyone cast the magnificent Jackie Chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?
Will undoubtedly play well in European markets , where Mr. Besson is a brand name , and in Asia , where Ms. Shu is an institution , but American audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic .
With Zoe Clarke Williams 's lackluster thriller `` New Best Friend '' , who needs enemies ?
With a romantic comedy plotline straight from the ages , this Cinderella story does n't have a single surprise up its sleeve .
With flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , Undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it 's impossible to care who wins .
With little visible talent and no energy , Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .
With the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which They is n't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright .
With very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like Swimming With Sharks and The Player , this latest skewering ... may put off insiders and outsiders alike .
Witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic .
Woody , what happened ?
Worthy of the gong .
Writer director Randall Wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic .
Written , flatly , by David Kendall and directed , barely , by There 's Something About Mary co writer Ed Decter .
Yet another Arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents .
Yet it 's not quite the genre busting film it 's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe .
You 'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie .
You ... get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone .
You can fire a torpedo through some of Clancy 's holes , and the scripters do n't deserve any Oscars .
You can tell almost immediately that Welcome to Collinwood is n't going to jell .
You do n't know whether to admire the film 's stately nature and call it classicism or be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace .
You have no affinity for most of the characters .
You may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by Argentine director Fabian Bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet .
Zellweger 's whiny pouty lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a

` The War of the Roses , ' trailer trash style .
`` Abandon '' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater .
`` Interview '' loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a TV episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into .
`` Sorority Boys '' was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad .
a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome .
but rather , ` How can you charge money for this ? '
entertaining enough , but nothing new
hard as this may be to believe , Here on Earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .
is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche .
lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking .
plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure Hollywood .
the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making
